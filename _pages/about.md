I am a Ph.D. candidate at the University of Waterloo in the [Algorithms and Complexity group](https://algcomp.uwaterloo.ca/), where I am fortunate to be advised by [Sepehr Assadi](https://sepehr.assadi.info/) and [Rafael Oliveria](https://cs.uwaterloo.ca/~r5olivei/). I got my Bachelor's Degree in Computer Engineering with a minor in Mathematics from Sharif University of Technology. My alternative name is Reza Hosseini Dolatabadi.

I am broadly interested in theoretical computer science with a focus on questions at the intersection of algorithms and complexity theory. I also like to think on extremal and algebraic combinatorics problems.
