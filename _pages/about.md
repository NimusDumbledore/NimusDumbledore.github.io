I am an incoming Ph.D. student at the University of Waterloo in the [Algorithms and Complexity group](https://algcomp.uwaterloo.ca/), where I am fortunate to be advised by [Sepehr Assadi](https://sepehr.assadi.info/) and [Rafael Oliveria](https://cs.uwaterloo.ca/~r5olivei/). I got my Bachelor's Degree in Computer Engineering with a minor in Mathematics from Sharif University of Technology. My alternative name is Seyed Reza Hosseini Dolatabadi.

I am broadly interested in theoretical computer science with a focus on questions at the intersection of algorithms and complexity theory. I also like to think on extremal and algebraic combinatorics problems.


## Internship
In Summer 2023, I was a research intern at [Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST)](https://cse.hkust.edu.hk/), where I worked under the supervision of [Mordecai Golin](https://cse.hkust.edu.hk/faculty/golin/). We published two papers in which we solved an optimization problem about minimum-cost Markov chains, which had applications in lossless coding.

## Extra Curricular Activities
I enjoy teaching mathematics to high school students, in particular those who are participating in mathematical olympiad competitions. I've been teaching Number Theory and Combinatorics to Iranian IMO participants since 2020. I also proposed several problems that appeared in the Iranian National Mathematical Olympiad contests.
